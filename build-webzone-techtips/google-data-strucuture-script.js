          "description": "SQL Server is a powerful and popular relational database management system that supports various data operations. However, sometimes you may want to keep track of the changes made to your data, such as when, who, and what was inserted, updated, or deleted in a table. This can be useful for auditing, debugging, or reporting purposes.One way to achieve this is by using triggers, which are special stored procedures that execute automatically in response to certain events. In this article, we will show you how to create and use triggers to monitor data changes in SQL Server tables. There are three types of triggers in SQL Server: DML, DDL, and Logon triggers. DML triggers fire when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement affects a table or view. DDL triggers fire when a CREATE, ALTER, or DROP statement affects a database object. Logon triggers fire when a user logs on to the database.",
